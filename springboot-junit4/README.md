This **Spring Boot project** illustrates how to use **QuickPerf** with **JUnit 4** during testing of a *repository*, a *service* or a *controller*.<br><br>
Note that some global annotations are configured in [QuickPerfConfiguration](src/test/java/org/quickperf/QuickPerfConfiguration.java). These annotations apply on each test.
